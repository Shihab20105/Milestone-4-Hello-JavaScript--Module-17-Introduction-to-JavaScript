    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</p>
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a high level, interpreted programming language used to make web pages more interactive. It let's you implement complex and beautiful things/design on web pages.</p>
    <h2>Origin of JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.</p>
